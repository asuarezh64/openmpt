How to compile the code:

- Visual Studio 2003/2005/2008/2010 is required. Express versions won't work as
  they don't include MFC.
- The VST 2.4 and ASIO SDKs are needed for compiling with VST and ASIO support.
  If you don't want this, uncomment #define NO_VST and #define NO_ASIO in the
  file StdAfx.h. Have a look at include/readme.txt to find out which exact files
  you need and where you can get them. If you need further help with the VST and
  ASIO SDKs, get in touch with the main developers. 
- You need the DirectX SDK to enable DirectSound output. If you don't want this,
  uncomment #define NO_DSOUND in the file StdAfx.h.
- To compile the project, open mptrack/MPTRACK.SLN (if you're using VS2003 or
  VS2005), mptrack/MPTRACK_08.SLN (VS2008) or mptrack/MPTRACK_10.SLN (VS2010)
  and hit the compile button! :)
